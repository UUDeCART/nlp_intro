    "A hypothetical healthcare delivery system has asked us to determine whether use of opioids is associated with increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. It is our job to identify patients with pneumonia so that the health services team can assess the risk based on pharmacy data. There is not enough time to manually read through the thousands of charts, so we will apply natural language processing for the task. A critical part of developing an NLP system is creating an annotated dataset for development of the tool and for testing of the tool. \n",
