    "# You are welcome to spend your time however you'd like but here are a few ideas of how to improve your system:\n",
    "* Improve targets.  Are there any False Negatives your system is missing?  Are there regular expressions that would help?\n",
    "* Improve modifiers.  Not all modifiers typically used in practice are the modifiers starter file.  Are there some to add?  Do some existing modifiers cause problems in your processing?  They can be changed or removed.\n",
    "* Improve document classification rules.  What rules work best?  What is the best \"default\" classification?\n",
    "* Consider handling of document \"sections\".  Are there certain headers or subsections which are more or less likely to contain evidence?  You could modify your own \"markup\" function to do this or you could add Modifiers to do this in some cases\n",

    "# Also before we get going, a few Pro Tips:\n",
