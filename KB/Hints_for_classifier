Your classifier should assign one of these values to each report:
PNEUMONIA_DOC_YES
PNEUMONIA_DOC_NO

Below are the categories assigned by modifiers to targets (an counts of the number of modifiers in the file that assign those categories). You will use these categories (which are output by pyConText for each target) to create your rules for classifying a document. Not all targets that provide evidence for pneumonia are assigned categories by modifiers. For example, "Consolidation is evident in right lower lobe." Consolidation is a target that has the category EVIDENCE_OF_PNEUMONIA, but it has no modifier-assigned categories. Whereas "No evidence of consolidation" will generate a target with the category EVIDENCE_OF_PNEUMONIA and with the following modifier-assigned categories: DEFINITE_NEGATED_EXISTENCE.
